<p>I’ve been working with clients from large to small, creating logos to TV shows. I’m always up for a challenge and available to create something for you, your company or your project. I ended up here through design school, working for photographers and a desire to create as projects have come up or I have been looking at new things I have adapted my work continually through medium and style, something I wish to keep doing to keep creating the best pieces I can.</p>
