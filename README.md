# Riley Bathurst Wordpress Site

This is a messy project as I continue to build it out but it started as a Wordpress project built with [foundation](https://github.com/zurb/foundation-sites)

Except I then pulled that out, which is still a little messy so getting everything in place for those being pulled out

Except now some of the project is being build with webpack so that is held over at [riley-webpack](https://github.com/rileybathurst/riley-webpack)

## Run the Sass
$ sass scss/app.scss css/app.css --watch

## Gutenberg
Means I have less template pages to work on but also a little less flexibility with the grid?
I guess thats not true I could float certain sections to things and others not that could be pretty interesing.
This needs a sub grid which is annoying but maybe an interesting piece to work on?
I'll try it out quick on firefox.

### Fixes needed
- Featured Video not showing full width
- HTML formatting to make sure the H tag is the first one
- nice additional movement with JS
- sort out the code block
